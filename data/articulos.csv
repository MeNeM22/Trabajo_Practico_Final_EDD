Scott', 'VE Kunst', 'C-H Chua', 'M. van Essen']",2050-01-01,"This paper presents a review and critique of the 20-year-old literature on institutional distance, which has greatly proliferated. We start with a discussion of the three institutional perspectives that have served as a theoretical foundation for this construct: organizational institutionalism, institutional economics, and comparative institutionalism. We use this as an organizing framework to describe the different ways in which institutional distance has been conceptualized and measured, and to analyze the most common organizational outcomes that have been linked to institutional distance, as well as the proposed explanatory mechanisms of those effects. We substantiate our qualitative review with a meta-analysis, which synthesizes the main findings in this area of research. Building on our review and previous critical work, we note key ambiguities in the institutional distance literature related to underlying theoretical perspectives and associated mechanisms, distance versus profile effects, and measurement. We conclude with actionable recommendations for improving institutional distance research.",article,,['Social Capital and Networks'],"['Construct (python library)', 'Institutionalism', 'Institutional theory', 'Institutional analysis', 'New institutionalism', 'Sociology', 'Work (physics)', 'Qualitative comparative analysis', 'Epistemology', 'Positive economics', 'Political science', 'Social science', 'Computer science', 'Economics', 'Politics']",,
W2610474987,Contested Sensemaking and Everyday Leadership Practices in the Context of UK Parliamentary Select Committees,['Annette Stansfield'],2042-01-01,"This thesis is an exploratory study of everyday leadership in UK parliamentary select committees. It is based on a detailed analysis of the parliamentary context for leadership and highlights the distinctive characteristics of a chair’s everyday select committee leadership practices. It examines how a chair addresses the challenges involved in the social processes of mobilising and aligning committee members and stakeholders around the committee’s purpose: making sense of complex and contentious public policy dilemmas. While still largely bound by parliamentary routines and tradition, select committees offer chairs increasing opportunities for flexibility, influence and leadership. Based on privileged research access to the workings of select committees, this is a real-time embedded comparative case study of similarities and differences in the enactment of leadership across two parallel contemporaneous inquiries within the same committee. It highlights the significance of sensemaking and sensegiving to leadership while proposing that the politicised context accentuates how challenge and conflict are integral to the daily enactment of leadership, which is often more volatile and much harder work than the literature suggests. It builds on existing leadership theory to contribute a novel conception of leadership, based on an adaptive combination of sensegiving, praxis and challenge in this context, with potentially wider application.",dissertation,,"['Management and Organizational Studies', 'Political and Economic history of UK and US', 'Public Policy and Administration Research']","['Sensemaking', 'Leadership style', 'Praxis', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Public relations', 'Political science', 'Leadership studies', 'Servant leadership', 'Shared leadership', 'Corporate governance', 'Public administration', 'Sociology', 'Management', 'Law']",,

In this study, we used Gryllidea (crickets) as a representative lineage and employed a phylogenetic comparative framework based on a robust phylogeny reconstructed from ultraconserved elements, mitochondrial genomes, nuclear ribosomal genes, DNA barcodes, and morphological traits. Our spatiotemporal evolutionary analyses indicate Gryllidea originated in the Early Jurassic, diverging into Grylloidea and Gryllotalpoidea, with marked increases in diversification rates at the ancestral node of Grylloidea and within Trigonidiinae and Goniogryllus of Gryllinae. Most species within these rapidly diversifying clades are distributed in the Oriental and Sino-Japanese regions. Integrating biotic (genomic and morphological) and abiotic (climatic and geographic) factors, we reveal that cricket diversification results from synergistic interactions of multiple factors, with biotic factors exerting a dominant influence, this pattern supports the Red Queen hypothesis. Elevated transposable element activity enhanced genomic plasticity, enabling morphological variation, while morphological innovations (leg and wing) promoted locomotor and habitat shifts, fostering niche expansion. Ecological opportunities also play a driving role. Temperature fluctuations (paleotemperature and modern bio_10) significantly influenced speciation. Biogeographically, tropical regions serve as engines of species origin, exhibiting higher diversity, and reveals divergent evolutionary modes between different biodiversity hotspots, distinguishing between ‘Out-of-the-Tropics’ and ‘Pure dispersal’.

W4393552097,Differentiated genomic footprints and connections inferred from 440 Hmong-Mien genomes suggest their isolation and long-distance migration,['Guanglin He'],2034-01-03,"Background: The underrepresentation of Hmong-Mien (HM) people in Asian genomic studies has hindered our comprehensive understanding of the full landscape of their evolutionary history and complex trait architecture. South China is a multi-ethnic region and indigenously settled by ethnolinguistically diverse HM, Austroasiatic (AA), Tai-Kadai (TK), Austronesian (AN) and Sino-Tibetan (ST) people, which is regarded as East Asia's initial cradle of biodiversity. However, previous fragmented genetic studies have only presented a fraction of the landscape of genetic diversity in this region, especially the lack of haplotype-based genomic resources. The deep characterization of demographic history and natural-selection-relevant genetic architecture of HM people was necessary. Results: We reported one HM-specific genomic resource and comprehensively explored the fine-scale genetic structure and adaptative features inferred from the genome-wide SNP data of 440 HM individuals from 33 ethnolinguistic populations, including previously unreported She. We identified solid genetic differentiation between HM people and Han Chinese at 7.64‒15.86 thousand years ago (kya) and split events between southern Chinese inland (Miao/Yao) and coastal (She) HM people in the middle Bronze Age period and the latter obtained more gene flow from Ancient Northern East Asians. Multiple admixture models further confirmed that extensive gene flow from surrounding ST, TK and AN people entangled in forming the gene pool of Chinese coastal HM people. Genetic findings of isolated shared unique ancestral components based on the sharing alleles and haplotypes deconstructed that HM people from the Yungui Plateau carried the breadth of previously unknown genomic diversity. We identified a direct and recent genetic connection between Chinese inland and Southeast Asian HM people as they shared the most extended identity-by-descent fragments, supporting the long-distance migration hypothesis. Uniparental phylogenetic topology and network-based phylogenetic relationship reconstruction found ancient uniparental founding lineages in southwestern HM people. Finally, the population-specific biological adaptation study identified the shared and differentiated natural selection signatures among inland and coastal HM people associated with physical features and immune function. The allele frequency spectrum of cancer susceptibility alleles and pharmacogenomic genes showed significant differences between HM and northern Chinese people. Conclusions: Our extensive genetic evidence combined with the historical documents supported the view that ancient HM people originated from the Yungui regions associated with ancient 'Three-Miao tribes' descended from the ancient Daxi-Qujialing-Shijiahe people. Then, some have recently migrated rapidly to Southeast Asia, and some have migrated eastward and mixed respectively with Southeast Asian indigenes, Liangzhu-related coastal ancient populations and incoming southward ST people. Generally, complex population migration, admixture and adaptation history contributed to the complicated patterns of population structure of geographically diverse HM people.",dataset,,"['Genetic Mapping and Diversity in Plants and Animals', 'Cancer-related molecular mechanisms research', 'RNA Research and Splicing']","['Isolation (microbiology)', 'Isolation by distance', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Biology', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Gene', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic structure']",,

W571046669,Critical examination of the various bases of asset valuation and their implications for income measurement,['Raymond K. Ashton'],2030-07-31,"The scope and coverage of this thesis can be divided into two distinct parts. The first part examines and reviews the various alternative accounting systems which have been proposed in the literature and recognisec as alternatives to HCA; the second part is a case study, based on the experlence of Dutch companies who have implemented one of the alternative accounting systems - RCA. The literature survey shows that each of the alternative accounting systems has strengths and weaknesses but that RCA, or CCA as it is known in the UK, is the system which commands most support. However, very little is known about the use to which management will put this information or its effect on reported profit. In the chapters dealing with the Dutch experience the Dutch literature was examined to see how similar or otherwise their system of RVA is to CCA. It was found that the original theory implicitly assumes identical replacement but that in practice the system is very similar to CCA. The replies to the questionnaire that was sent to companies participating in the survey showed that:- i) RC rates were used to evaluate divisional and group performance; ii) RCs were used in the compilation of budgets and standard costs; iii) the accuracy of the RC data was open to question because of the lack of available and reliable indices; iv) very little account was taken of technological change and changes in a firm's product-mix. In the chapter which examined the effect of RCA on reported profit it was shown that the effect on individual companies varied sub~tantially. The effect of RCA on five ratios was also examined. Wlth the exceptlon of the dividend cover there was very little change in the rankings of the ratios when these were compared on a HC and RC basis. The last relationship that was examined was between each company's share price on three different dates, and shareholders' funds on both bases. It was found that the null hypothesls of no difference between the various combinations could not be rejected. The results of this survey have formed the basis of a larger project, now underway, into the use and effect of RCA on companies in the United Kingdom.",book,,"['Financial Reporting and Valuation Research', 'Housing Market and Economics']","['Valuation (finance)', 'Economics', 'Actuarial science', 'Financial economics', 'Business', 'Econometrics', 'Accounting']",,
W613303488,Entrepreneurship and regional development: the role of clusters,['Héctor Rocha'],2030-07-31,"This dissertation develops and tests the first theoretical model to understand and explain the differential impact of clusters and industrial agglomerations on both entrepreneurship and the relationship between entrepreneurship and development at the regional level. Clusters and entrepreneurship face high visibility among academics and policyrnakers, given that similar historical conditions explain their resurgence, and similar potential impacts on employment and innovation highlight their socio-economic importance. Yet conceptual, theoretical, and methodological constraints prevent the study of their relationship and joint impact on regional development. This dissertation aims to make theoretical and practical contributions addressing these constraints. Defining entrepreneurship as the creation of new organisations and a cluster as a geographically proximate group of interconnected firms and institutions in related industries, this study creates an intrinsic paradigm in which clusters, creation of organisations, and regional development are distinguished from industrial agglomerations, entry, and industry growth, respectively. Based on this intrinsic paradigm and a socio-economic approach, it elaborates a theoretical model that hypothesises a synergy between the liability of newness faced by new firms and the provision of external economies, established relationships, legitimisation processes, and complementary linkages by clusters. To empirically test the model, this study uses the 97 German Planning Regions as units of analysis, a multiple method and data approach to measure and identify clusters, and an OLS fixed-effect model to test the hypotheses. Clusters are measured using both quantitative secondary data and qualitative data from the existing literature on clusters and a survey of German regional experts in 31 regions. Entrepreneurship is measured using a four-year (2000-2003) pooled data taken from the German GEM dataset. The results show that clusters matter to entrepreneurship and to the relationship between entrepreneurship and regional development, but industrial agglomerations do not. Based on the theoretical elaboration and these results, this dissertation outlines theoretical contributions, practical implications for academics and policyrnakers, and directions for future research.

W751932963,Managerial competence as a determinant of organizational performance,['Tony Cockerill'],2030-07-31,"Despite the important contribution made by managers to modern economies, little research has been undertaken into the behaviour of managers that is related to organizational performance. Upper level managers (i.e., executives) have been studied least. Consequently, this thesis has created and tested hypotheses on the relationship between managerial behaviour (i.e., competence) and organizational effectiveness at executive level. In addition, the thesis has also created and tested hypotheses on the relationship between managerial competence and individual variables. Directed by Campbell et al's (1970) model of managerial effectiveness, a review was made of the literature on organizational performance, managerial behaviour, environmental and individual variables. Based on this review, a revised model of managerial effectiveness was created from which a model of executive effectiveness in dynamic environments was derived. Eighteen hypotheses were drawn from the latter model for testing in this study. Behavioural and Individual data were collected by means of observation, job analysis interview, biographical Interview, Kirton's Adaption-Innovation Inventory and Ghiselli's Self-Description Inventory from a sample of 30 executives working for an international financial services organization. A short-term and long-term measure of the performance of the units managed by the 30 executives was gathered. A statistically significant, positive relationship was found between eleven ""High Performance Managerial Competencies"" (HPMC) and the long-term competence/performance of organizational units. Managerial competence was found to be related to three individual factors: Adaption-Innovation, Decision-making Style and Supervisory Ability. Furthermore, results appertaining to environmental variables as well as the development of the HPMC are reported and discussed. A validated model of managerial effectiveness is presented. Finally, the managerial and research implications of the research are discussed.",dissertation,,['Business and Economic Development'],"['Competence (human resources)', 'Business', 'Knowledge management', 'Psychology', 'Business administration', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology']",,
W2341838758,Quality management practice: universal or context dependent? an empirical investigation,['Rui Sousa'],2030-07-31,"Quality management has often been advocated as being universally applicable to organisations and organisations activities. This universal stance is part of the emergence of a new paradigm in Operations Management based on the assumption that the adoption of best practice in a wide range of areas leads to superior performance (the best practice paradigm). This is in contrast with the manufacturing strategy contingency approach in which the field of Operations Management has been strongly rooted from its inception, which advocates internal and external consistency between manufacturing strategy choices (the strategic choice paradigm). In addition, as quality management has matured, more recent rigorous academic studies have raised doubts as to the universal validity of its set of practices. Despite these tensions, there is still little empirical research conducted in quality management aimed at shedding light on the question: Are quality management practices contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy context? This study investigates this question by examining, via case based research, the use of quality management practices across plants representing a range of different strategic contexts in the UK electronics industry. By selecting plants mature on quality from a single very competitive industry and controlling for process technology, the study aimed to isolate the effects of a plant's strategic context on quality management practice. Overall, the results suggest that although a few practices seem to be universally applicable, several others are strongly contingent on a plant's strategic context. The study also identifies mechanisms by which a plant's strategic context affects quality management practices. At a more general level, the study lends support to the existence of links between a plant's manufacturing strategy and the pattern of use of best practices. This finding is in agreement with the contingency view of the strategic choice paradigm and in contrast with the universalistic approach of the best practice paradigm.",dissertation,,"['Hermeneutics and Narrative Identity', 'Aging, Elder Care, and Social Issues', 'Health, Medicine and Society']","['Quality (philosophy)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Business', 'Computer science', 'Process management', 'Epistemology', 'History', 'Philosophy']",,
W386153629,"Capital asset pricing, valuation of the firm and optimal capital structure",['C. Harvey Rorke'],2030-07-31,"The subject area of interest is capital structure. It is hypothesized that firms finance themselves with various types of conditional claims against a primary risky cash flow. Each claim issued is in turn risky and we value each of these according to an asset pricing model. Although any conceivable set of claims could be used we restrict the discussion to the well known claims: debt and equity. Since investors value claims on the basis of after tax flows we investigate several different tax structures and their implications for optimal capital structure. In brief we find that some tax structures imply 100% debt financing, some imply 100% equity financing while others imply that intermediate combinations of equity and debt are optimal. This last result is extremely interesting as we argue that those tax structures are the most realistic ones considered. For this problem we find it necessary to develop the theory of comparative statics in the pricing of capital assets and in particular to consider the portfolio aspects which give motivation to firms to adopt these optimal structures. The analysis is undertaken under both risk neutrality and risk-aversion assumptions and similar results are found for both cases.",book,,"['Economic theories and models', 'Financial Reporting and Valuation Research']","['Valuation (finance)', 'Capital asset pricing model', 'Consumption-based capital asset pricing model', 'Business', 'Financial economics', 'Capital structure', 'Cost of capital', 'Pre-money valuation', 'Economics', 'Monetary economics', 'Finance', 'Microeconomics']",,

W2913717743,The Functional Results of Surgical Percutaneous Joystick Reduction Therapy for Isolated Severely Angulated Radial Neck Fracture in Children,['Muzahim Ahmed Abbas'],2030-06-01,"\nBackground: Radial neck fractures in children account for 5 to 10% of all elbow fractures in children. They are extra-articular fractures of the radius proximal to the bicipital tuberosity. The physis is typically involved as a Salter-Harris I or II pattern. Alternatively, the fracture sometimes is extraphyseal, through the metaphysis. In children there is considerable potential for remodeling after these fractures. Up to 30° of radial head tilt and up to 3 mm of transverse displacement are acceptable. Many modalities of treatment are available regarding Surgical &amp;Non-Surgical treatments. Objectives: To evaluate the functional outcome after surgical percutaneous joystick reduction therapy of severely angulated radial neck fracture in children. Type of the study: A prospective study. Methods: During the period between February/2012 and May/2015, we made a prospective study of (18) patients suffered from O′Brien type II&amp;III radial neck fracture with severe angulation that require surgery seen at Al-Kindy Teaching Hospitals. However, we select a group of children who had more than 30° of Radial head angulation really cannot treated by conservative method. Angulated radial neck fractures in children reduced with a percutaneous Kirschner wire. We select of surgical procedure after failure of thumbing intraoperatively. The primary indication for surgery was changing type II&amp;III to typeI which can go on in manage conservatively. Results: All the (18) patients treated with percutaneous pinning techniques were followed-up, clinically and radiographically evaluated pre-surgery, post-surgery and finally (6) months after surgery. The mean angulation of the fractures was 64° (30° - 90°) before reduction and 10°(0° - 22°) after reduction. Mean fracture displacement after reduction in all cases was less than 3 mm. Range of Motion (ROM) in flexion, extension, pronation and supination was the functional parameter in our study as graded by (the grading system of Steele). We obtained an outcome of excellent results in 15 patient (83%), good results in 3 patients (17%) and we have no fair or poor results. Conclusions Percutaneous Joystick Reduction Techniqueusing K-wire in children with radial neck fractures is a safe, short, easy procedure requires only good technical measures, minimally invasive in nature with minimal hospitalization time, has a minimal morbidity and complication rates, it is recommended surgical treatment that can achieve recovery of normal radial neck angulation, elbow motion and yielding excellent results.\n",article,,"['Elbow and Forearm Trauma Treatment', 'Orthopedic Surgery and Rehabilitation', 'Bone fractures and treatments']","['Percutaneous', 'Medicine', 'Reduction (mathematics)', 'Surgery', 'Mathematics']",,

W7104254224,An Analysis of Filial Relations in the Teachings of Jesus and Muhammad from the Perspective of Comparative Ethics and Scriptural Reasoning,"['Abdelhay, Ahmed Ragab Abdelkhalek']",2030-01-01,"This thesis offers a comparative-ethical analysis of textual tensions in the teachings of Jesus and Muhammad about filial relations as well as their reception in contemporary Christian-Muslim relations. While the issue of textual tension has been widely used, and abused, in the context of religious polemics, it is virtually ignored in the practice of interreligious dialogue. One reason for the absence of effective Christian-Muslim dialogue on textual tension is the absence of a clear hermeneutical approach that facilitates and promotes mutual understanding between the two religious traditions. The problem of textual tension can be addressed if the strengths of, and opportunities presented by, interreligious dialogue and comparative ethics are brought together. Interreligious dialogue, on the one hand, has the clear purpose of promoting mutual understanding but it lacks a clear approach to the practice of dialogue. The academic study of comparative ethics, on the other hand, offers well-established methods for interpreting and comparing religious texts, but it is less clear when it comes to defining the purpose of comparison. The aim of this thesis is to build on the strengths of interreligious dialogue and comparative ethics by providing a hermeneutical-dialogical analysis of textual tensions in the teachings of Jesus and Muhammad about filial relations. Drawing on Ruben Zimmermann’s approach to ‘implicit ethics’, the study will examine the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament and of Muhammad in the Qurᵓān and the Ḥadīth before investigating the reception of both teachings by the Egyptian scholars Mattā Al-Miskīn and Muhammad Al-Shaᶜrāwī, respectively. The thesis argues that interpreting sacred texts comparatively from the perspective of ‘implicit ethics’ can be effectively applied to the practice of Scriptural Reasoning, which, in turn, promotes a text-centred form of interreligious dialogue.",dissertation,,[],"['Context (archaeology)', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'New Testament', 'Hermeneutics', 'Old Testament', 'Interpretation (philosophy)']",,
